/**
	\page timer_descr Timer callbacks
	
	The template class \ref tscb::generic_timer_service "generic_timer_service"
	defines the interface which receivers of timer callbacks can use to register
	themselves. The single template parameter determines the data type used to
	represent time values.
	
	A specialization of this template, \ref tscb::timer_service "timer_service",
	uses boost::posix_time::ptime to represent time values, and is thus suitable
	to cooperate with boost::posix_time::microsec_clock and
	\ref tscb::ioready_dispatcher "ioready_dispatcher" to dispatch wall clock
	timer events.
	
	\section timer_registration "Registration for events"
	
	Interested receivers can register functions to be called at specified points
	in time at the \ref tscb::generic_timer_service "generic_timer_service" interface. Receivers
	can use the \ref tscb::generic_timer_service::timer "generic_timer_service::timer" functions
	for this purpose; they can be used in the following fashion:
	
	\code
		class TimerHandler {
		public:
			bool onTimer(long time) throw()
			{
				// perform timer action
				time+=1000;
				return true; // rearm timer 1000 units in the future
			}
			void finish(void) throw()
			{
				delete this;
			}
			void register(tscb::generic_timer_service<long> *service) throw(std::bad_alloc)
			{
				// call us at point "6000" in time
				service->timer(boost::bind(&TimerHandler::onTimer, this, _1),
					6000);
			}
		}
	\endcode
	
	In the previous example, the <TT>onTimer</TT> method of the corresponding object
	will be called at the specified point in time; moreover the timer will
	rearm itself 1000 "units" in the future by returning <TT>true</TT>, effectively
	creating an (imprecise) periodic timer (see section \ref periodic_timers below
	how to create precise periodic timers). Returning <TT>false</TT> from the
	timer callback functions indicates that it does not want to be called again.
	
	The callback function is passed the current time (as it is known to the
	callback service provider) as first argument. It is very likely that this
	is slightly <I>after</I> the desired point in time (due to notification and 
	scheduling latency); the implementation can find out by what amount of time
	the callback is to late by inspecting this value and comparing with the
	desired point in time.
	
	
	\section timer_callback_cookies Callback link handles for timer callbacks
	
	The \ref tscb::generic_timer_service::timer "generic_timer_service::timer" functions returns a
	reference to a callback link object that represents the connection between the
	callback service provider and the receiver. The return value
	can be stored by the caller:
	
	\code
		tscb::timer_callback link;
		link=service->timer<TimerHandler, &TimerHandler::onTimer, &IOHandler::finish>
			(tscb::current_time()+1000, this);
	\endcode
	
	The link object can later be used to cancel the timer:
	
	\code
		link->disconect();
	\endcode
	
	Afterwards, the timer function will not be called again. If the timer
	callback function is running concurrently in another thread and it
	returns <TT>True</TT> (indicating that it would like to rearm itself)
	it is cancelled <I>nevertheless</I>. Calling <TT>disconnect</TT> always
	takes precedence.
	
	\section periodic_timers Precise periodic timers
	
	Since timer callback functions may be called with a slight "lag", it is not
	possible to implement precise periodic timers by simply incrementing the
	current time with a fixed value to calculate the next callback time.
	Instead the receiver has to keep track of the "originally desired" point
	in time and used that as a base instead:
	
	\code
		class TimerHandler {
		public:
			long long next_callback_due;
			
			bool onTimer(long long time) throw()
			{
				// calculate amount of time we are late
				long long lag=time-next_callback_due;
				// perform timer action
				
				next_callback_due+=1000;
				time=next_callback_due;
				return true; // rearm timer 1000 usecs in the future
			}
			void finish(void) throw()
			{
				delete this;
			}
			void register(tscb::timer_service *service) throw(std::bad_alloc)
			{
				next_callback_due=current_time()+1000;
				
				// call us 1000 usecs in the future
				service->timer<TimerHandler, &TimerHandler::onTimer, &TimerHandler::finish>
					(tscb::next_callback_due, this);
			}
		}
	\endcode
	
	Programmers are encouraged to use this feature to provide if they want to
	be called again (either periodically, or with varying timeouts);
	it is more efficient to rearm an existing timer with a new timeout value
	than to unregister an expired timer and create a new one.
	
	\section timerqueue_dispatcher_descr Timer dispatchers
	
	Free-standing implementations of the \ref tscb::timer_service "timer_service"
	interface suitable for timer event dispatching are provided by the
	\ref tscb::generic_timerqueue_dispatcher "generic_timerqueue_dispatcher" 
	class template (and its specialization,
	\ref tscb::timerqueue_dispatcher "timerqueue_dispatcher", respectively).
	The implementations use a fibonacci heap (see \ref fibheap_descr) to
	store pending timers.
	
	The \ref tscb::generic_timerqueue_dispatcher "generic_timerqueue_dispatcher"
	provides the \ref tscb::generic_timerqueue_dispatcher::run_queue "run_queue"
	member function; it expects the current time value to be given and
	will process all timers that have expired up to this point in time.
	If timers are added/modified during this queue run so that their
	expiry time is equal to, or before the current time, they will
	be processed as well.
	
	The function returns true if there are timers pending after processing
	the queue, and will indicate the point in time when the next callback
	is due. It should be called in the following fashion:
	
	\code
		tscb::timerqueue_dispatcher *dispatcher;
		...
		long long next_timer;
		long long now=tscb::current_time();
		bool timer_pending;
		do {
			next_timer=now;
			// process timers
			timer_pending=dispatcher->run_queue(next_timer);
			// no more timers pending? -> abort
			if (!timer_pending) break;
			// re-read current time
			now=tscb::current_time();
			// compare with next pending timer and run again, if required
		} while(now>=next_timer);
		
		// wait appropriate amount of time, until next timer is due
		if (timer_pending)
			sleep_milliseconds(next_timer-now);
	\endcode
	
	As shown above, the current time should be rechecked after processing the
	timer queue because processing the timer callbacks takes its time as well.
	
	The returned time value can be used to calculate the time to "sleep"
	until the next timer is due. Since timers can be added during the
	"sleep" period, the dispatcher cooperates with an
	\ref tscb::eventflag "eventflag" to interrupt the sleep if a timer
	has been added that would expire within the sleep period:
	
	\code
		tscb::eventflag *flag;
		tscb::timerqueue_dispatcher *dispatcher;
		...
		dispatcher=new tscb::timerqueue_dispatcher(flag);
	\endcode
	
	The caller must <I>atomically</I> wait on the eventflag and the
	timeout value calculated above. One way to achieve this is to
	couple the timer dispatching with an
	\ref tscb::ioready_dispatcher "ioready_dispatcher"; see
	\ref dispatcher_descr how to simultaneously dispatch timer
	and io events from one thread.
