/**
	\brief Event flag interface

	Provides the interface of an event flag synchronization primitive.
	An event flag can be in one of two possible states: set or cleared.
	If the flag is set, a \ref wait operation on the flag will
	not block, and the thread will continue unimpeded. If the
	flag is cleared, a \ref wait operation will block until
	the state of the flag is changed to set.

	In contrast to condition variables, threads will not block on an
	event flag if it has been set previously. Mutexes and
	event flags can be used as replacements for mutexes and condition
	variables, however the stateful nature of event flags requires
	maintaining correct ordering of operations to avoid
	missed wakeups.

	The important distinguishing property between eventflags and
	condition is that eventflags can be set from within
	signal handlers: For all eventflag implementations, the
	\ref eventflags::set operation is guaranteed to be wait-free
	and async-signal safe.

	Eventflags are used in <B>tscb</B> to provide a
	generic interface for thread wakeup.
